# Images Directory

This directory contains static images served by the application.

## Directory Structure

- `/hero/` - Hero section background images and graphics
- `/logos/` - Company logos, partner logos, and brand assets
- `/icons/` - Static icon files (favicons, app icons, etc.)

## Usage

Images in this directory can be accessed via:
```
/images/[subdirectory]/filename.ext
```

For example:
- `/images/logos/company-logo.png`
- `/images/hero/background-1.jpg`
- `/images/icons/favicon.ico`

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive filenames
2. Optimize images for web (compress, use appropriate formats)
3. Consider using WebP format for better compression
4. Organize by category in subdirectories
5. Use consistent naming conventions (kebab-case recommended)

## Image Formats

- **JPEG/JPG** - For photographs and complex images
- **PNG** - For images with transparency or simple graphics
- **WebP** - For modern browsers (better compression)
- **SVG** - For vector graphics and icons
